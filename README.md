# th-project2
This project adds pagination to a list of students in an unobtrusive way.  The students will still show if javascript does not load, but the pagination adds an extra feature.  The number of page links show up depending on the number of students in the list and the links are created dynamically.  

The search feature is an extra credit feature.  A search will happen on keyup events or when clicking the search button to match the value in the input to the h3 text content of the students name.  It will return a result if the student's names include any of the search term.
